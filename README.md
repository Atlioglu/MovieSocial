## Interactive Animations (Movie Detail Screen)

- **Romantic** 
  Touching anywhere spawns animated heart icons.

- **Thriller**

- **Horror** 
  Initially, the screen is dark.  
  Users can turn on a virtual light bulb to reveal the content with a warm yellow glow.

## Technologies & Architecture

- **Networking**: Retrofit
  Error handling and coroutine support are implemented for better user experience.  

- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
  Clear separation of concerns.
  Easier maintainability and scalability.
  Improved testability.
  **ViewModels** manage UI-related data and handle business logic.
 
- **Dependency Injection**: Koin
  Koin is used for dependency injection to:
  Inject **ViewModels** into screens.
  Provide **Retrofit services** and **Repository** instances as singletons.
  Inject shared utility functions used across multiple ViewModels.
  This eliminates boilerplate code, reduces coupling, and improves testability.

- **UI/UX**: Material Design, Animations
- **Notifications**: Firebase
- **Coroutines** for asynchronous operations.
